    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pancakes recipe is one that is originally from
        allrecipes.com that has been adapted slightly to our
        tastes. Mya has loved these pancakes ever since she 
        could eat them and now helps to make them!

        <h4>Step 1</h4> 
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together 
        in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add 
        milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>

        <h4>Step 2</h4> 
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high
