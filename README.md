This project is my first actual project from the Odin Project. I will be
creating a basic site that house some of my favourite recipes. I'm looking
forward to practicing my skills that I've learned so far. I've already 
set thiings up using the Terminal, something I wouldn't have thought
I'd be able to do a couple weeks ago. 

I'm going to be practicing utilizing VSCode to create the site. I'm 
cautiously nervous about using GIT properly - I'll be revisiting 
the information surrounding commits before I really dive in. I understand
the basics of commits, but still not fully confident when to do them.
Hopefully this project will help to clarify that.

Overall I'm pleased with my progress and have learned a lot already. Here's
to a successful project!
